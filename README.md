Day 6 – SQL (Filtering, Sorting & Aggregation)

✔ Filtering & Sorting
Used WHERE for conditions
Sorted results with ORDER BY (ASC/DESC)
Removed duplicates using DISTINCT

✔ Grouping & Aggregation
Used GROUP BY with functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN
Applied conditions on groups using HAVING

✔ Range & Pattern Matching
Used BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, LIKE
Checked NULL values with IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

✔ LIMIT & OFFSET
Limited rows using LIMIT
Found 2nd highest salary using LIMIT … OFFSET

✔ COUNT Logic
Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column)
Counted NULLs using IF(email IS NULL, 1, 0)
